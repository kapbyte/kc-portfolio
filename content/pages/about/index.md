Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is **Kelechi Chinaka**.

- ðŸ’¼ Software Development Engineer @[Enyata](https://enyata.com/).

### Why this blog?
Over the course of my career working as a Software Engineer, I've led engineering teams, and also built enterprise applications in different domains. I'm skilled using programming languages like **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Go (Programming Language)**, **Swift**. I enjoy providing solutions that **scale**.

I started this blog because I want to share my journey in tech, writings, and anything of interest. Having this blog will be a great avenue to share my journey as I navigate life.

I hope through this medium I can connect with people from different works of life and learn from their journeys too.
